## Overview

First read through this guide to see if there's anything that you might need to adjust. While there are many items on this page, a majority of them only apply to addons or custom code. We've noted who each item would apply to so you can more easily scan through the changes.

### Upgrade using Composer

In your `composer.json`, change the `statamic/cms` requirement:

```json
"statamic/cms": "^4.0" // [tl!--]
"statamic/cms": "^5.0" // [tl!++]
```

Then run:

``` shell
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

## High impact changes

### PHP and Laravel support
**Affects apps using PHP < 8.1 or Laravel < 10.**

- The minimum version of PHP is now 8.1.
- The minimum version of Laravel is now 10.

We highly recommend upgrading all the way to Laravel 11 and PHP 8.3.

## Medium impact changes

...

## Low impact changes

### Seed removed from `shuffle` modifier
**Affects apps using the shuffle modifier with an argument.**

In Laravel 11, the underlying randomization technique was made more secure and no longer supports seeds. If you need to support seeds, you will need to use a custom modifier.

```
{{ my_array | shuffle:123 }} {{# [tl! --] #}}
{{ my_array | custom_shuffle_with_seed:123 }} {{# [tl! ++] #}}
```

The shuffle modifier without an argument will continue to work without any modification needed.
